      # -- (list) Metrics for autoscaling decisions. This section specifies the metrics used by the Horizontal Runner Autoscaler (HRA) to make
      # scaling decisions. The metrics define how the autoscaler should react to the current state of the runners to adjust the
      # number of replicas accordingly. These metrics are crucial for ensuring that the number of runner pods scales appropriately
      # based on the actual workload and utilization.
      metrics:
      - type: PercentageRunnersBusy
        # -- (string) Increase the number of runners when the percentage of busy runners exceeds this threshold. This helps to handle
        # increased load by adding more runner pods to manage the workload effectively.
        scaleUpThreshold: '0.75'

        # -- (string) Decrease the number of runners when the percentage of busy runners falls below this threshold. This helps to reduce
        # resource usage by scaling down the number of runner pods when the load decreases.
        scaleDownThreshold: '0.25'

        # -- (string) When scaling up, the number of runners will be multiplied by this factor. For example, a factor of '2' means the number
        # of runners will double when scaling up.
        scaleUpFactor: '2'

        # -- (string) When scaling down, the number of runners will be multiplied by this factor. For example, a factor of '0.5' means the
        # number of runners will be halved when scaling down.
        scaleDownFactor: '0.5'

    # -- (object) Kubernetes service account configuration.
    # A service account provides authentication information used by pods to interact with the Kubernetes API server within the cluster.
    # This configuration allows the runner pod to access necessary cluster resources by assigning appropriate permissions.
    # Using a service account enhances cluster security and allows for the association with specific IAM roles to access AWS resources.
    serviceAccount:
      # -- (bool) Determines whether to create a new service account. Setting this to 'true' will create a new service account.
      create: true

      # -- (bool) Automatically mount service account token.

      # -- (list) Image pull secrets for the service account. This allows the service account to pull images from private container registries.
      imagePullSecrets: []
        # - name: my-registry-secret

      # -- (object) Annotations for the service account.
      # Supports AWS IAM integration via IRSA or EKS Pod Identity for secure access to AWS resources.

    # -- (object) Topology Spread Constraints for the runner. This setting defines how pods should be spread across different topology domains,
    # such as nodes or availability zones, to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. It helps to distribute the pods evenly
    # across the specified topology domains to avoid overloading a single domain and to improve resiliency.

    # -- (object) Persistent Volume Claims for the runner. This setting allows you to define persistent storage for the runner pods.
    # Multiple PVCs can be defined and will be mounted into the runner pods. Each claim can be configured to be created
    # by this chart or reference an existing PVC. This is useful for caching dependencies, build artifacts, or other
    # data that needs to persist across runner pod restarts.

      # cache:
      #   # -- (bool) Whether to create the PVC. Set to false to use an existing PVC.
